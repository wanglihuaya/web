    <h2>Commencement address, 2005, Stanford University (excerpt)</h2>

    <article>

      <p>I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I
        never graduated from college. To be honest, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
        <mark>Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. </mark>No big deal, just three stories.</p>
      <p>The first story is about connecting the dots.</p>
      <p>I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18
        months or so before I really quit. Why did I drop out?</p>
      <p>The story begins when I was born. <mark>My biological mother was a young, unmarried college graduate. She
          decided to put me up for adoption. </mark>She really wanted me to be adopted by college graduates. So when I
        was born,she had made all the preparations. So my parents got a call in the middle of the night asking:
        <mark>"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"</mark> They replied: </p>
      <p>"Of course!" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my
        father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the adoption contract. <mark>She only
          reluctantly
          agreed a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.</mark></p>
      <p>At seventeen, I did go to college. But I foolishly chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford. My
        working-class parents spent almost all of their savings on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see
        the value in it. I had no idea what I really wanted to do and no idea how college was going to help me figure it
        out. <mark>But here I was spending almost all of my parents' life savings. So I decided to drop out. I thought
          it was
          the right decision. I can't deny that I was scared, but looking back it was one of the best decisions of my
          life.</mark> The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the classes that didn't interest me. Then I can
        start taking
        courses that look interesting.</p>
